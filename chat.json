Added a `recoverERC20` function to allow the owner to recover any accidentally sent tokens (except the staking token).\n4. Improved code comments for better readability.\n\nPlease note that the contract still uses placeholder addresses for the staking and reward tokens. You should replace these with the actual token addresses before deployment:\n\n- stakingToken: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3\n- rewardToken: 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512\n\nThe contract now includes all necessary functionality for staking, unstaking, claiming rewards, and managing the reward rate.

The contract now correctly implements the `setTokenName` function without using the non-existent `_setName` function.\n2. The `name()` and `symbol()` functions are overridden to allow for dynamic changes to the token name.\n3. The contract includes all requested functionality: setting token name, setting token supply, and withdrawing tokens.\n4. All functions have appropriate access control (onlyOwner) and input validation.\n5. Events are emitted for important state changes.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The initial token name and symbol are set to \"MintingToken\" and \"MTK\" respectively, but can be changed later.\n- The contract mints tokens to itself when increasing the supply, which can then be withdrawn by the owner.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract without any constructor arguments.\n2. Use the `setTokenName` function to change the token name if desired.\n3. Use the `setTokenSupply` function to set the initial token supply.\n4. Use the `withdrawTokens` function to transfer tokens from the contract to a specified address.\n\nRemember to always interact with the contract using the account that was used to deploy it, as only the owner can perform these operations.\n",

Removed setRewardRate() and set a fixed reward rate in the constructor.\n5. Added an addRewards() function for the owner to add ETH to the contract for rewards.\n6. Updated events and state variables to reflect ETH usage.\n7. Added receive() and fallback() functions to prevent accidental ETH transfers.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The reward rate is set to 1 ETH per day per ETH staked. You may want to adjust this based on your requirements.\n- The contract relies on the owner to add sufficient ETH for rewards using the addRewards() function.\n- Be cautious when interacting with this contract, as it deals directly with ETH.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract ensuring you have enough ETH for gas fees.\n2. As the owner, call addRewards() with some ETH to fund the reward pool.\n3. Users can stake ETH by calling stake() and sending ETH along with the transaction.\n4. Users can unstake by calling unstake() with the desired amount.\n5. Users can claim rewards by calling claimRewards().\n\nRemember to thoroughly test this contract in a test environment before deploying it to the mainnet.\n",

Wallet connection with network checking and switching\n2. Input fields for recipient address and token amount\n3. Buttons to mint and withdraw tokens\n4. Status updates for user feedback\n\nPlease note the following caveats:\n1. Only the contract owner can mint and withdraw tokens. The component doesn't check if the connected wallet is the owner, so non-owner attempts will fail.\n2. The component uses ethers.js v5.7 as requested, which may not be compatible with the latest MetaMask versions. You might need to update the ethers version in the future.\n3. Error messages are general and might not provide specific details about why a transaction failed.\n4. The component doesn't include any token balance display or other read functions from the contract.\n\nTo use this component, ensure you have MetaMask or a similar Web3 wallet installed, and you're connected to the Holesky testnet.\n",

The contract implements a linear vesting schedule with a cliff period.\n4. Functions are provided to release vested tokens and check vested amounts.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. The contract is initialized with a placeholder token address. You should call the `setToken` function after deployment to set the correct token address.\n2. The owner must approve the contract to spend tokens on their behalf before tokens can be released.\n3. All time-related parameters (startTime, cliffDuration, vestingDuration) are in seconds.\n\nTo deploy and interact with the contract:\n1. Deploy the contract.\n2. Call `setToken` to set the correct token address.\n3. Use `addBeneficiary` to add vesting schedules for beneficiaries.\n4. Beneficiaries can call `releaseVestedTokens` to claim their vested tokens.\n5. Anyone can check the vested amount for a beneficiary using `calculateVestedAmount`.\n\nRemember to ensure that the owner's wallet has sufficient token balance and has approved the contract to spend tokens before attempting to release vested tokens.\n",
