Added a `recoverERC20` function to allow the owner to recover any accidentally sent tokens (except the staking token).\n4. Improved code comments for better readability.\n\nPlease note that the contract still uses placeholder addresses for the staking and reward tokens. You should replace these with the actual token addresses before deployment:\n\n- stakingToken: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3\n- rewardToken: 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512\n\nThe contract now includes all necessary functionality for staking, unstaking, claiming rewards, and managing the reward rate.

The contract now correctly implements the `setTokenName` function without using the non-existent `_setName` function.\n2. The `name()` and `symbol()` functions are overridden to allow for dynamic changes to the token name.\n3. The contract includes all requested functionality: setting token name, setting token supply, and withdrawing tokens.\n4. All functions have appropriate access control (onlyOwner) and input validation.\n5. Events are emitted for important state changes.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The initial token name and symbol are set to \"MintingToken\" and \"MTK\" respectively, but can be changed later.\n- The contract mints tokens to itself when increasing the supply, which can then be withdrawn by the owner.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract without any constructor arguments.\n2. Use the `setTokenName` function to change the token name if desired.\n3. Use the `setTokenSupply` function to set the initial token supply.\n4. Use the `withdrawTokens` function to transfer tokens from the contract to a specified address.\n\nRemember to always interact with the contract using the account that was used to deploy it, as only the owner can perform these operations.\n",

Removed setRewardRate() and set a fixed reward rate in the constructor.\n5. Added an addRewards() function for the owner to add ETH to the contract for rewards.\n6. Updated events and state variables to reflect ETH usage.\n7. Added receive() and fallback() functions to prevent accidental ETH transfers.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The reward rate is set to 1 ETH per day per ETH staked. You may want to adjust this based on your requirements.\n- The contract relies on the owner to add sufficient ETH for rewards using the addRewards() function.\n- Be cautious when interacting with this contract, as it deals directly with ETH.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract ensuring you have enough ETH for gas fees.\n2. As the owner, call addRewards() with some ETH to fund the reward pool.\n3. Users can stake ETH by calling stake() and sending ETH along with the transaction.\n4. Users can unstake by calling unstake() with the desired amount.\n5. Users can claim rewards by calling claimRewards().\n\nRemember to thoroughly test this contract in a test environment before deploying it to the mainnet.\n",
