Fixed the compilation error in the constructor by adjusting the rewardRate calculation.\n2. Added a `pendingRewards` function to allow users to check their pending rewards without claiming.\n3. Added a `recoverERC20` function to allow the owner to recover any accidentally sent tokens (except the staking token).\n4. Improved code comments for better readability.\n\nPlease note that the contract still uses placeholder addresses for the staking and reward tokens. You should replace these with the actual token addresses before deployment:\n\n- stakingToken: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3\n- rewardToken: 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512\n\nThe contract now includes all necessary functionality for staking, unstaking, claiming rewards, and managing the reward rate. It also includes safety measures such as reentrancy protection and safe token transfers.\n",

The contract now correctly implements the `setTokenName` function without using the non-existent `_setName` function.\n2. The `name()` and `symbol()` functions are overridden to allow for dynamic changes to the token name.\n3. The contract includes all requested functionality: setting token name, setting token supply, and withdrawing tokens.\n4. All functions have appropriate access control (onlyOwner) and input validation.\n5. Events are emitted for important state changes.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The initial token name and symbol are set to \"MintingToken\" and \"MTK\" respectively, but can be changed later.\n- The contract mints tokens to itself when increasing the supply, which can then be withdrawn by the owner.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract without any constructor arguments.\n2. Use the `setTokenName` function to change the token name if desired.\n3. Use the `setTokenSupply` function to set the initial token supply.\n4. Use the `withdrawTokens` function to transfer tokens from the contract to a specified address.\n\nRemember to always interact with the contract using the account that was used to deploy it, as only the owner can perform these operations.\n",
